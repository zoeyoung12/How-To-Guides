# Useful Resources For Starting Out on Data Scientist   

The following provides instruction for what you should install on your computer. 

# Download / Set Up the following:


1. GPG key and tools

        You need to set up GPG keys to enable you to send and receive encrypted messages. 

        Please follow the instructions below and set up key with your hellosoda.com email. 

        Introduction
        There is often a need to exchange with one another some credentials or other sensitive data. 
         It is a real temptation to become careless or lazy especially when there is an urge to send something on speed.

        To follow best practices on exchanging sensitive data the data needs to be encrypted and the recipient of 
        this data needs to be able to decrypt it. To achieve this we use Gnu Privacy Guard. 
        GPG is currently used to encrypt data and internal document signing, but it can be used in case external 
        partner has the necessary knowledge .

  ## Installing and using GPG on Mac OSX
